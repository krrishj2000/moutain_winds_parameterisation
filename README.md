This is a commonplace for all codes and processed data used in the paper "Predictability of mean summertime diurnal winds over ungauged mountain glaciers". 
The jupyter notebook named "Cryosphere_figures.ipynb" contains the code to create all figures in the paper, with the exception of Figure 3, which was made in Powerpoint.  Note that code for sections 3.2.2 (Fitting Eqs. 2â€“4 to model parameters) and beyond are only provided here. Obtaining the model parameters and optimising the number of static variables in the model are not given here.
